## Overview

### Objectives

- Consume a web service
- Create a responsive UI
- Create multiple pages and work with routing
- Use local storage and work with app state

### Task

The task is to create a two-screen application listing items from the API of my choice.
The application should include the functionality for adding items to “favorites”.

**First screen** should consist of **all items displayed** in a form of a list or a grid (or anything that works for displaying multiple items). From this screen, users should be able to add items to a list of their favorite items, as well as remove them from the favorites list. Each item should also somehow indicate whether it is already saved to favorites or not.

**The second screen** will be a list of all items marked as **favorites**, and should include the functionality for removing the items from favorites.

Use **one of free** [REST APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) or [GraphQL APIs](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/community/backend/8-free-to-use-graphql-apis-for-your-projects-and-demos/) to **get the data** for your application.

Make your application **responsive** across all screens.
